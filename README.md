## Getting Started

For this version of the Coding Challenge, I made use of a Aura Component showing each permuataion on the view. All the code is in the Javascript Helper file of the Aura Component Bundle. Does the same thing as the Java version but just wanted to try out in the Aura Component. To view the Aura Comoponent deploy the source to an org and preview it in the Application.
